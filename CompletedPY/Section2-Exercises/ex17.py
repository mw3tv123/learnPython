'''
Write a function that yields the value of every iteration of computing
the square root of a number using Newton's method
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).

NOTE: The number of iterations is provided by user.

Example:
def compute(number, iterations):
    # TODO: Put your code here.
    pass

for v in compute(612, 3):
    print(v)

# 35.6
# 26.395505617978
